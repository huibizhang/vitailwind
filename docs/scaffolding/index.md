### Keep it easy, Keep it simple.

Nothing even "setup tailwindcss in jit mode" can stop you developing! Now, you can create project that pre built-in tailwindcss jit mode just using one-line command. Try it!

### How Can I do ?

To start, open terminal at your directory where you want to put project. And, run following commands:

```bash
npm init vitawind@latest {project-name} -- {template}
```
base on this command, please give project name and choose a template, for example:

```bash
npm init vitawind@latest my-first-app -- --vue
```

### Template List
Go to [See all templates](./templates). Or, you can using our [Creator](./creator) tool to quick start.
